## Project Overview
This is a senior project completed at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, UAE from January 2023 to May 2023. The project involved developing a Chrome extension for detecting malicious websites using machine learning.

Key features:
- Implemented anomaly detection using SVM (Support Vector Machine) models
- Identified irregular behaviors in web traffic to detect malicious websites

## Setup
1. Install required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
2. Run `data_prep.py` to preprocess the data
3. Run `svm_model_training.py` to train the SVM model
4. Package the model and web extension for deployment
